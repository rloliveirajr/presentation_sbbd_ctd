\begin{abstract}
Text-based social media channels, such as Twitter, produce
torrents of opinionated data about the most diverse topics and entities.
The analysis of such data (aka. sentiment analysis) is quickly becoming a key feature in recommender systems
and search engines.
A prominent approach to sentiment analysis is based on the application of classification techniques, that is,
content is classified according to
the attitude of the writer.
A major challenge, however, is that Twitter
follows the data stream model, and thus classifiers must operate
with limited resources, including labeled data and time for building classification models. Also challenging is the fact that
sentiment distribution may change as the stream evolves.
In this paper we address these challenges by proposing algorithms that separate relevant training instances at each time step, so that training windows are kept small while providing to the classifier the capabilities to suit itself to, and to recover itself from, sentiment drifts. Simultaneously providing both capabilities to the classifier, however, is
a conflicting-objective problem, and our algorithms employ notions of Economics in order to balance both capabilities. We performed the analysis of events that reverberated on Twitter,
and the comparison against the state-of-the-art reveals improvements in terms of error reduction (up to 14\%) and reduction of training resources (by orders of magnitude).
